/**
 * SECTION:gdata-batch-operation
 * @short_description: GData batch operation object
 * @stability: Unstable
 * @include: gdata/gdata-batch-operation.h
 *
 * #GDataBatchOperation is a transient standalone class which represents and handles a single batch operation request to a service. To make a batch
 * operation request: create a new #GDataBatchOperation; add the required queries, insertions, updates and deletions to the operation using
 * gdata_batch_operation_add_query(), gdata_batch_operation_add_insertion(), gdata_batch_operation_add_update() and
 * gdata_batch_operation_add_deletion(), respectively; run the request with gdata_batch_operation_run() or gdata_batch_operation_run_async(); and
 * handle the results in the callback functions which are invoked by the operation as the results are received and parsed.
 *
 * If authorization is required for any of the requests in the batch operation, the #GDataService set in #GDataBatchOperation:service must have
 * a #GDataAuthorizer set as its #GDataService:authorizer property, and that authorizer must be authorized for the #GDataAuthorizationDomain set
 * in #GDataBatchOperation:authorization-domain. It's not possible for requests in a single batch operation to be authorized under multiple domains;
 * in that case, the requests must be split up across several batch operations using different authorization domains.
 *
 * If all of the requests in the batch operation don't require authorization (i.e. they all operate on public data; see the documentation for the
 * #GDataService subclass in question's operations for details of which require authorization), #GDataBatchOperation:authorization-domain can be set
 * to %NULL to save the overhead of sending authorization data to the online service.

 *
 * Run the #GDataBatchOperation synchronously. This will send all the operations in the batch operation to the server, and call their respective
 * callbacks synchronously (i.e. before gdata_batch_operation_run() returns, and in the same thread that called gdata_batch_operation_run()) as the
 * server returns results for each operation.
 *
 * The callbacks for all of the operations in the batch operation are always guaranteed to be called, even if the batch operation as a whole fails.
 * Each callback will be called exactly once for each time gdata_batch_operation_run() is called.
 *
 * The return value of the function indicates whether the overall batch operation was successful, and doesn't indicate the status of any of the
 * operations it comprises. gdata_batch_operation_run() could return %TRUE even if all of its operations failed.
 *
 * @cancellable can be used to cancel the entire batch operation any time before or during the network activity. If @cancellable is cancelled
 * after network activity has finished, gdata_batch_operation_run() will continue and finish as normal.
 *
 * Return value: %TRUE on success, %FALSE otherwise
